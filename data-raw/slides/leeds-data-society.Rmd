<!-- msg: Looks like I'll have a second change to demonstrate this code: 55% of people in the poll wanted sea level rise (SLR) to be the example dataset for the dplyr/sf integration workshop tomorrow. Watch this space -->
<!-- 14:15 - 15:00 - 45 minute talk  -->
<!-- Aims: show-off the book, provide overview, some useful things in it -->

# Aim

- What is R and what is it good for?
- An introduction to the tidyverse
- An introduction to the sf package
- Spatial data and the tidyverse
- Making maps with R


```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

**sf** (first release in 2016) implements the open standard data model *simple features*. Get **sf** with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

The workshop also uses a dataset from the **spData** package, which can be installed with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
```

For more on this see: [github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr).

# Why R? (source: [stackoverflow.blog](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/))

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://stackoverflow.blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tag_growth_scatter-1-771x675.png")
```

## Introduction to the tidyverse

- Software for 'data science' is evolving
- In R, packages **ggplot2** and **dplyr** are popular
- Now integrated into a 'metapackage': the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- Which works with 'tidy data' (from `vignette("tidy-data")`):


>    - Each variable forms a column.
>    - Each observation forms a row.
>    - Each type of observational unit forms a table

- Historically spatial R packages have not been compatible with the **tidyverse**

## Enter sf

- **sf** is a recently developed package for spatial (vector) data
- Combines the functionality of three previous packages: **sp**, **rgeos** and **rgdal**
- Has many advantages, including:
    - Faster data I/O
    - More geometry types supported
    - Compatibility with the *tidyverse*
    
That's the topic of this workshop

---

## Attaching the packages

- You can use packages with `packagename::functionname()`
- But by usually they are loaded at the beginning of an R session:


```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(spData)
```

---

## The structure of spatial data in sf

- Let's look at a dataset representing the United States:

```{r}
us_states[1:3, 1:2]
```

## Spatial data and the tidyverse

- Works just like normal data in the tidyverse

- Beware of name conflicts though:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

---

# Data manipulation in the tidyverse (dplyr)

- **dplyr** provides a 'A grammar for data manipulation'
- It allows arguments to be 'piped', e.g.:

```{r}
states1 = us_states %>%
  slice(1)
states2 = us_states %>% 
  filter(grepl(pattern = "^A", x = NAME)) %>% 
  top_n(n = 2, wt = total_pop_15)
```


---

# Tidyverse pitfall example: binding rows


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rbind(states1, states2)     # works
bind_rows(states1, states2) # fails
```

```
Error in .subset2(x, i, exact = exact) : 
  attempt to select less than one element in get1index
```

Work-around (see article in [geocompr.github.io/geocompkg](https://geocompr.github.io/geocompkg/articles/tidyverse-pitfalls.html) for more pitfalls):

```{r, warning=FALSE}
us_data = st_set_geometry(us_states, NULL)
d = bind_rows(us_data, us_data)
d_sf = st_sf(d, geometry = c(us_states$geom, us_states$geom))
```

## Making maps with R

- See Chapter 8 on Making maps with R, at: [geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html)

## Now over to you

- Get into groups of 2-5 and say hello
  - What is each person's name?
  - How much R experience do you have?
  - What do you hope to get out of today?

- Take a look around RStudio
  - Create a new project
  - Try in install a new package
  - Load the packages we'll use in this practical

- The practical
  - Navigate to [geocompr.robinlovelace.net](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html)
  - Answer the first 3 questions of Chapter 3
  - Take a look at chapter 2
  - Answer questions 4:6 in Chapter 3
  - Take a look at Chapter 8 and make some maps!
  - Challenge: answer all questions in Chapter 3
  - Bonus (advanced): make a pull request that improves the book

## Final thing

A group of us are thinking about starting-up the Leeds R Users group.

- For academic and non-academic researchers
- Interested in getting involved?
