# Reading and writing data

--

- Often the first and last stage in projects

--

- Overlooked but vital

--

- If input data is wrong, analysis will be wrong

--

Packages

```{r}
library(sf)
library(spData)
```


---

## Geographic data I/O in context

- Session content based on Chapter 6 of *Geocomputation with R*, [Geographic data I/O](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html)

--

- Part of a wider process

--

Depends on knowing:

- which datasets are *available*

--

- where they can be *found*

--

- how to *retrieve* them

--

- how to save them

---

## Project planning

![](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/_main_files/figure-html/4-1-1.png)

---

## Components of geographic data I/O

- Retrieving open data (Section [7.2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html#retrieving-data) of Geocomputation with R)

--

- Geographic data packages (7.3)

--

- Geographic web services (7.4)
--

- File formats (7.5)

--

- Data input (I) (7.6)

--

- Data output (O) ([7.7](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/read-write.html#data-output))

---

## 'Geoportals'


- A vast and ever-increasing amount of geographic data is available on the internet

--

- In some ways there is now *too much* data

--

- Some datasets are of poor quality.

- Various 'geoportals' (web services providing geospatial datasets such as [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?metadata_type=geospatial)) are a good place to start

- See [Wikipedia Geoportal page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoportal))

- [GEOSS portal](http://www.geoportal.org/)

- [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)

- [EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)

## Data packages

```{r datapackages, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
datapackages = tibble::tribble(
  ~`Package`, ~Description,
  "getlandsat", "Provides access to Landsat 8 data.",
  "osmdata", "Download and import of OpenStreetMap data.",
  "raster", "getData() imports administrative, elevation, WorldClim data.",
  "rnaturalearth", "Access to Natural Earth vector and raster data.",
  "rnoaa", "Imports National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climate data.",
  "rWBclimate", "Access World Bank climate data."
)
knitr::kable(datapackages, format = "html",
             caption = "Selected R packages for geographic data retrieval.", 
             caption.short = "Selected R packages for geographic data retrieval.")
```

--

Example: `pct` and `stats19` packages

---

## Web services

Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) created specifications for web services (collectively known as OWS, which is short for OGC Web Services)

- Include the Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), the Web Coverage Service (WCS) and even a Wep Processing Service (WPS) - example:

```{r 07-read-write-plot-8}
base_url = "http://www.fao.org/figis/geoserver/wfs"
q = list(request = "GetCapabilities")
res = httr::GET(url = base_url, query = q)
res$url
txt = httr::content(res, "text")
xml = xml2::read_xml(txt)
xml
```


---

## File formats

Many file formats out there

- Worth thinking about which to use

```{r, echo=FALSE}
file_formats = tibble::tribble(~Name, ~Extension, ~Info, ~Type, ~Model, 
                         "ESRI Shapefile", ".shp (the main file)", "Popular format consisting of at least three files. No support for: files > 2GB;  mixed types; names > 10 chars; cols > 255.", "Vector", "Partially open",
                         "GeoJSON", ".geojson", "Extends the JSON exchange format by including a subset of the simple feature representation.", "Vector", "Open",
                         "KML", ".kml", "XML-based format for spatial visualization, developed for use with Google Earth. Zipped KML file forms the KMZ format.", "Vector", "Open",
                         "GPX", ".gpx", "XML schema created for exchange of GPS data.", "Vector", "Open",
                         "GeoTIFF", ".tiff", "Popular raster format similar to `.tif` format but stores raster header.", "Raster", "Open",
                         "Arc ASCII", ".asc", "Text format where the first six lines represent the raster header, followed by the raster cell values arranged in rows and columns.", "Raster", "Open",
                         "R-raster", ".gri, .grd", "Native raster format of the R-package raster.", "Raster", "Open",
                         "SQLite/SpatiaLite", ".sqlite", "Standalone  relational database, SpatiaLite is the spatial extension of SQLite.", "Vector and raster", "Open",
                         "ESRI FileGDB", ".gdb", "Spatial and nonspatial objects created by ArcGIS. Allows: multiple feature classes; topology. Limited support from GDAL.", "Vector and raster", "Proprietary",
                         "GeoPackage", ".gpkg", "Lightweight database container based on SQLite allowing an easy and platform-independent exchange of geodata", "Vector and raster", "Open"
                         )
file_formats
# knitr::kable(file_formats, format = "html",
#              caption = "Selected spatial file formats.")
```


---

## Data input

Simplest file format for geographic data: .csv file

.pull-left[


```{r}
xy = read.csv(text = 
"lon,lat,v1
0,50,a
0,60,b
-30,-20,c")
# plot(xy)
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
plot(xy)
```

]


---

## Converting xy data to an sf data frame

```{r}
xy_sf1 = sf::st_as_sf(xy, coords = c("lon", "lat"))
plot(world$geom)
plot(xy_sf1, add = T)
```

---

## Reading-in a .geojson file

```{r}
# short link for file stats19_sf.geojson 
# saved at: github.com/geocompr/geocompkg/releases
# curl -i https://git.io -F "url=https://github.com/geocompr/geocompkg/releases/download/0.1/stats19_sf.geojson"
u = "https://git.io/fjsKQ"
stats19_sf = read_sf(u)
plot(stats19_sf)
```

---

## Downloading and reading a file

A 2 stage process
:

```{r}
u = paste0("https://github.com/geocompr/geocompkg/releases",
           "/download/0.1/stats19_sf.gpkg")
download.file(u, "stats19.gpkg") # may need mode = "wb" argument...
stats19_gpkg = read_sf("stats19.gpkg")
st_crs(stats19_gpkg) # geojson only works properly with WGS84 CRS
```

---

## Rds files

R's own compressed binary format

```{r}
saveRDS(world, "world.Rds")
world2 = readRDS("world.Rds")
identical(world, world2)
```

- Saves all aspects of any R object

--

- Not so easy for non R users to read-in

---

## Data output

-- Use `write_sf()`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_sf(world, "world.shp")
write_sf(world, "world.geojson")
```


---

## Exercises

1. Save the object `nz` from the **spData** package to the following 4 file formats: nz.Rds, nz.geojson, nz.gpkg, nz.shp

1. Which is biggest? Which is smallest? Which would you use?

1. Bonus: Use the functions `list.files()` and `file.size()` together to create a data frame of file sizes ranked in order


```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(spData)
saveRDS(nz, "nz.Rds")
sf::write_sf(nz, "nz.geojson")
sf::write_sf(nz, "nz.shp")
sf::write_sf(nz, "nz.gpkg")
f = list.files(pattern = "nz")
fs = file.size(f)
fs_df = tibble::tibble(f, fs)
dplyr::arrange(fs_df, desc(fs))
```
