knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


These practicals aim to test your knowledge and improve your skills in relation to the 2 day Geocomputation with R course, hosted at https://git.io/geocompr-2-day-course

It will use the following CRAN packages:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(osmdata)
library(pct)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(mapview)
```

# Project set-up

- Check your packages are up-to-date with `update.packages()`
- Create an RStudio project with an appropriate name for this course (e.g. `geo2day`)
- Create a script called `set-up.R`, e.g. with the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
file.edit("set-up.R") 
```

- Create a data frame representing coffee consumption across the country as follows (note: this may not be representative):

```{r, echo=TRUE}
person_name = c("arron", "bob", "carl")
n_coffee = c(5, 1, 0)
likes_herbal_tea = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
region_name = c("west-yorkshire", "avon", "london")
coffee = tibble::tibble(person_name, n_coffee, likes_herbal_tea,
                        region_name)
```

- Filter rows in which the `person_name == "bob"`
- Create a subset of the data containing only rows in which `likes_herbal_tea` is `TRUE`
- Bonus: return all rows in which the `person_name` contains the letter `o` (hint: type `?grepl` for help)

- Save the data as a file called `coffee.csv` using `readr::write_csv()`
- Read-in the data to objects called `coffee2` and `coffee3` using `read_csv()` from the `readr` package and `read.csv()` from base R as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
readr::write_csv(coffee, "coffee.csv")
coffee1 = read_csv("coffee.csv")
coffee2 = read.csv("coffee.csv")
```

- Use the function `purrr::map_chr(coffee2, class)` to find the class of each column. What's the difference between `coffee2` and the other datasets?

- Bonus: create a spatial object representing coffee consumption by region

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
coffee1$region_name = coffee1$home_region
coffee1$region_name = NULL
coffee_sf = dplyr::right_join(pct::pct_regions, coffee1,
                              by = c("region_name" = "home_region"))
plot(coffee_sf)
library(spData)
coffee_data
```

Note: use Ctl-Shift-M to create the pipe operator

```{r, eval=FALSE}
%>% %>% %>% %>% %>% %>% %>% %>% %>% %>% %>% 
```


# R's spatial ecosystem

- Create an interactive map showing the course location with the following commands (you should see the map shown below):

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
library(osmdata)
library(tmap)
lida = opq("Leeds") %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "Worsley Building") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
# m = mapview::mapview(lida$osm_polygons, zoom = 16)
lida_centroid = lida$osm_polygons %>% 
  sf::st_centroid()
lon = sf::st_coordinates(lida_centroid)[1]
lat = sf::st_coordinates(lida_centroid)[2]
m = tm_shape(lida$osm_polygons) +
  tm_polygons(col = "red") +
  tm_view(set.view = c(lon + 0.005, lat - 0.005, 15)) +
  tm_basemap(server = leaflet::providers$CartoDB.Positron) +
  tm_minimap(server = leaflet::providers$OpenTopoMap, zoomLevelOffset = -10) +
  tm_scale_bar()
tmap_mode("view")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("geolida_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png")
```

- Bonus: add a layer showing a road along which you travelled to get here (hint: you can search for road names at http://osm.org/ )


1) Think about the terms 'GIS', 'GDS' and 'Geocomputation' described above. Which (if any) best describes the work you would like to do using geo* methods and software and why?

<!-- - There is no right answer. Your choice may depend on the methods (if it's focussed on spatial relationships and map overlays, GIS may be more appropriate), sector ('data science' is a generic term used in many tech companies) or personal preference. -->

2) Provide 3 reasons for using a scriptable language such R for geocomputation instead of established GIS programs such as QGIS.

<!-- - Reproducibility: a sequence of operations is much easier to save and share when using a scripting language. -->
<!-- - Scalability: scripting languages make it easy to break-up the work and parallelise, making it more scalable. -->
<!-- - Flexibility: the building blocks of the language allows it to interface efficiently with external software, enabling R to perform a wide range of tasks (e.g. animations, online interactive maps). -->
<!-- - Efficiency: the GUI of GIS programs can be slow to use and install. -->

3) Name two advantages and two disadvantages of using mature packages compared with 'cutting edge' packages for spatial data (for example **sp** vs **sf**).

<!-- - `+` Stability (newer packages may be more buggy) -->
<!-- - `+` Number of packages currently supported (although this is changine) -->
<!-- - `-` Slow performance for some operations -->
<!-- - `-` Non standard data representation -->
<!-- - `-` Fewer features -->
<!-- - `-` (Maybe) less future-proof -->


# Attribute operations


Load `sf` and `spData` with the following commands:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(spData)
```

You should now have the `world` data in your namespace, which you can check by plotting the object, which should generate the following result:

```{r, out.height="9.6cm"}
plot(world)
```

You can filter and subset the data as follows:

```{r}
# subset rows (countries) in Asia
asia = world %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia")
# subset columns with certain names
world_small = world %>% 
  select(name_long, continent, pop)
```

1. Create and plot an object called `europe` representing the countries of Europe
1. Use the commands `dim()` and `nrow()` to find out: how many countries are there in Europe?
    - Bonus: cast the `europe` object into a new object called `europe_poly`. How many rows does it have and why does it have more rows than `europe` does?
1. Create an object called `world_names` containing only country names.
    - Bonus: what is the class of this new object?
    - Bonus: What is its geometry type?
1. Create an object containing only countries with at least 100 million inhabitants
    - Bonus: which continent has most small countries (with less than 10 million inhabitants)?

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
europe = world %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe")
nrow(europe)
europe_poly = europe %>% 
  st_cast(to = "POLYGON")
nrow(europe_poly)
plot(europe_poly)
```


# Spatial data operations

The input data for this part will be point and polygon data representing New Zealand (`nz`), from Chapter 4 of *Geocomputation with R*.
The best place to start is to plot the data so the first exercise is:

- Create a plot of the data so it looks like the map of New Zealand below (hint: use the `add = TRUE` argument).

```{r}
plot(nz$geom)
plot(nz_height["elevation"], add = TRUE)
```

1. Canterbury is the region of New Zealand containing most of the 100 highest points in the country. Create an object called `canterbury` and use this to subset all points within the region. How many of these high points does the Canterbury region contain?
```{r 04-spatial-operations-45, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(nz) + qtm(nz_height)
canterbury = nz %>% filter(Name == "Canterbury")
canterbury_height = nz_height[canterbury, ]
nrow(canterbury_height) # answer: 70
```
1. Which region has the second highest number of `nz_height` points in, and how many does it have?
```{r 04-spatial-operations-46, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nz_height_count = aggregate(nz_height, nz, length)
nz_height_combined = cbind(nz, count = nz_height_count$elevation)
nz_height_combined %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  dplyr::select(Name, count) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  slice(2)
```
    - Bonus: geralizing the question to all regions, how many of New Zealand's 16 regions contain points which belong to the top 100 highest points in the country? Which regions?
    - Bonus: create a table listing these regions in order of the number of points and their name.
```{r 04-spatial-operations-47, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
nz_height_count = aggregate(nz_height, nz, length)
nz_height_combined = cbind(nz, count = nz_height_count$elevation)
nz_height_combined %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  dplyr::select(Name, count) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count)) %>% 
  na.omit()
```

# Reading and writing geographic data

The solutions assume the following packages are attached (other packages will be attached when needed):

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)
library(spData)
```

1) List and describe three types of vector, raster, and geodatabase formats.

<!-- Vector formats: Shapefile (old format supported by many programs), GeoPackage (more recent format with better support of attribute data) and GeoJSON (common format for web mapping). -->

<!-- Raster formats: GeoTiff, Arc ASCII, R-raster (see book for descriptions). -->

<!-- Database formats: PostGIS, SQLite, FileGDB (see book for details). -->

2) Name at least two differences between `read_sf()` and the more well-known function `st_read()`.

<!-- `st_read()` prints outputs and keeps strings as text strings (`st_read()` creates factors). This can be seen from the source code of `read_sf()`, which show's it wraps `st_read()`: -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
read_sf
```

3) Read the `cycle_hire_xy.csv` file from the **spData** package as a spatial object (Hint: it is located in the `misc\` folder, `system.file("misc/cycle_hire_xy.csv", package = "spData")`).
What is a geometry type of the loaded object? 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
c_h = read.csv(system.file("misc/cycle_hire_xy.csv", package = "spData")) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("X", "Y"))
c_h
```

<!-- The loaded object has the POINT geometry. -->

4) Download the borders of Germany using **rnaturalearth**, and create a new object called `germany_borders`.
Write this new object to a file of the GeoPackage format.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rnaturalearth)
germany_borders = ne_countries(country = "Germany", returnclass = "sf")
plot(germany_borders)
st_write(germany_borders, "germany_borders.gpkg")
```

5) Bonus: Download the global monthly minimum temperature with a spatial resolution of five minutes using the **raster** package.
Extract the June values, and save them to a file named `tmin_june.tif` file (hint: use `raster::subset()`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gmmt = raster::getData("worldclim", var = "tmin", res = 5)
names(gmmt)
gmmt_june = raster::subset(gmmt, "tmin6")
writeRaster(gmmt_june, "tmin_june.tif")
```

# Geometric operations


Some of the exercises use a vector (`random_points`) and raster dataset (`ndvi`) from the **RQGIS** package.
They also use a polygonal 'convex hull' derived from the vector dataset (`ch`) to represent the area of interest:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(RQGIS)
data(random_points)
data(ndvi)
ch = st_combine(random_points) %>% 
  st_convex_hull()
```


1) Generate and plot simplified versions of the `nz` dataset.
Experiment with different values of `keep` (ranging from 0.5 to 0.00005) for `ms_simplify()` and `dTolerance` (from 100 to 100,000) `st_simplify()` .
    - At what value does the form of the result start to break-down for each method, making New Zealand unrecognizable?
    - Advanced: What is different about the geometry type of the results from `st_simplify()` compared with the geometry type of `ms_simplify()`? 
What problems does this create and how can this be resolved?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(rmapshaper::ms_simplify(st_geometry(nz), keep = 0.5))
plot(rmapshaper::ms_simplify(st_geometry(nz), keep = 0.05))
# Starts to breakdown here at 0.5% of the points:
plot(rmapshaper::ms_simplify(st_geometry(nz), keep = 0.005))
# At this point no further simplification changes the result
plot(rmapshaper::ms_simplify(st_geometry(nz), keep = 0.0005))
plot(rmapshaper::ms_simplify(st_geometry(nz), keep = 0.00005))
plot(st_simplify(st_geometry(nz), dTolerance = 100))
plot(st_simplify(st_geometry(nz), dTolerance = 1000))
# Starts to breakdown at 10 km:
plot(st_simplify(st_geometry(nz), dTolerance = 10000))
plot(st_simplify(st_geometry(nz), dTolerance = 100000))
plot(st_simplify(st_geometry(nz), dTolerance = 100000, preserveTopology = TRUE))

# Problem: st_simplify returns POLYGON and MULTIPOLYGON results, affecting plotting
# Cast into a single geometry type to resolve this
nz_simple_poly = st_simplify(st_geometry(nz), dTolerance = 10000) %>% 
  st_sfc() %>% 
  st_cast("POLYGON")
nz_simple_multipoly = st_simplify(st_geometry(nz), dTolerance = 10000) %>% 
  st_sfc() %>% 
  st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON")
plot(nz_simple_poly)
length(nz_simple_poly)
nrow(nz)
```

2) In the first exercise in this [Chapter](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-data-operations.html) it was established that Canterbury region had 70 of the 101 highest points in New Zealand.
Using `st_buffer()`, how many points in `nz_height` are within 100 km of Canterbury?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
canterbury = nz[nz$Name == "Canterbury", ]
cant_buff = st_buffer(canterbury, 100)
nz_height_near_cant = nz_height[cant_buff, ]
nrow(nz_height_near_cant) # 75 - 5 more
```

3) Find the geographic centroid of New Zealand.
How far is it from the geographic centroid of Canterbury?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
cant_cent = st_centroid(canterbury)
nz_centre = st_centroid(st_union(nz))
st_distance(cant_cent, nz_centre) # 234 km
```

4) Most world maps have a north-up orientation.
A world map with a south-up orientation could be created by a reflection (one of the affine transformations not mentioned in this [section](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/geometric-operations.html#affine-transformations)) of the `world` object's geometry.
Write code to do so.
Hint: you need to use a two-element vector for this transformation.
    - Bonus: create a upside down map of your country.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
world_sfc = st_geometry(world)
world_sfc_mirror = world_sfc * c(-1, -1)
plot(world_sfc)
plot(world_sfc_mirror)

us_states_sfc = st_geometry(us_states)
us_states_sfc_mirror = us_states_sfc * c(-1, -1)
plot(us_states_sfc)
plot(us_states_sfc_mirror)
## nicer plot
# library(ggrepel)
# us_states_sfc_mirror_labels = st_centroid(us_states_sfc_mirror) %>% 
#   st_coordinates() %>%
#   as_data_frame() %>% 
#   mutate(name = us_states$NAME)
# us_states_sfc_mirror_sf = st_set_geometry(us_states, us_states_sfc_mirror)
# ggplot(data = us_states_sfc_mirror_sf) +
#   geom_sf(color = "white") +
#   geom_text_repel(data = us_states_sfc_mirror_labels, mapping = aes(X, Y, label = name), size = 3, min.segment.length = 0) +
#   theme_void() 
```

# Visualisation

These exercises rely on the object `europe`.
Create it using the `world` and `worldbank_df` datasets from the **spData** package as follows (see Section [2.2](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html#intro-sf) of Geocomputation with R for details):

```{r 08-mapping-41, warning=FALSE}
europe = world %>% 
  filter(continent == "Europe", !is.na(iso_a2)) %>% 
  left_join(worldbank_df, by = "iso_a2") %>% 
  dplyr::select(name, subregion, gdpPercap, HDI, pop_growth) %>% 
  st_transform("+proj=aea +lat_1=20 +lat_2=-23 +lat_0=0 +lon_0=25")
```

1. Create a map showing the geographic distribution of the Human Development Index (`HDI`) across Europe with base **graphics** (hint: use `plot()`) and **tmap** packages (hint: use `tm_shape(europe) + ...`).
1. Extend the **tmap** created for the previous exercise so the legend has three bins: "High" (`HDI` above 0.7), "Medium" (`HDI` between 0.55 and 0.7) and "Low" (`HDI` below 0.55).
    - Bonus: improve the map aesthetics, for example by changing the legend title, class labels and color palette.
1. Represent `europe`'s subregions on the map. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(europe["subregion"])
```

# Working on your own data

- Option A: identify a dataset that is similar to one you use in your work and ask questions of it (e.g. what does it tell us about policy X)

- Option B: work through one of the applied chapters in *Geocomputation with R*, on [transport](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) planning, [location](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/location.html) analysis or [species](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/eco.html) distributions (chapters 12:14 in Geocomputation with R, hosted at https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net )
